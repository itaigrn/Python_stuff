An efficient calculator of intersections between line-segments in 2D using plane-sweep algorithm.
Input is given as 4 coordinates for each row representing a line segment - first two numbers are the x and y coordinates of one endpoint and the last two of the other.

Robust and efficient program.
Assumes a length strictly greater than 0 for each line segment.
